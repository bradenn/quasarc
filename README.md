# Quasarc

A beta version is now available at https://quasarc.bradenn.com

Quasarc is a Node.js based media network. Quasarc uses Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and a plethera of other Node tools.
This is a pet project of mine, this project gets repurposed quite often.

I started this project with zero knowledge of Javascript or Node. I pretty much dove in with my eyes closed. Everything has been a learning experience.

### Documentation
The app model has recently been updated from an REST Api server-client system to a pure server-client model.
###### There is no longer a non-deprecated REST API. (One will be added later)
